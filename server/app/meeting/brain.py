"""Meeting task brain.

A Claude Agent SDK agent that performs a meeting participant's request against
EXTERNAL MCP servers (Jira / Slack / Gmail) reached over HTTP with a bearer
token. Same shape as app/verify/brain.py (ClaudeSDKClient query loop), but the
tools live on remote servers we point at via config rather than in-process.

Executes immediately (no confirmation step) and returns ONE short spoken
sentence describing what it did, which the gate speaks back into the meeting.
Only servers with both a URL and a token configured are registered; if none
are, it says so instead of erroring.

participant has just addressed you by name and asked you to do something. Carry
out the request using the available tools (Jira, Slack, Gmail, Linear, Google
Drive) and then reply with ONE short sentence, in plain spoken English, stating
exactly what you did (include the created ticket key, channel, or recipient when
relevant).

Rules:
- Act immediately; do not ask follow-up questions unless the request is
  impossible without a missing required field, in which case say what you need.
- Be literal about what you did. If you could not do it, say so plainly.
- No markdown, no lists, no emojis — your reply is spoken aloud.
- Keep it under 25 words."""
