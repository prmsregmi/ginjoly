"""Typed settings loaded from the environment / .env.

Every key is optional so the module imports cleanly even when a given
integration is not configured yet; callers check for the specific key they
need. STT+TTS default to GRADIUM and extraction to NEMOTRON, with
DEEPGRAM/CARTESIA/ANTHROPIC reachable via env; the meeting brain uses ANTHROPIC.
Long-term memory writes to an Obsidian vault on disk (OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH).
