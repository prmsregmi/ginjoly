"""Conversation flow: collect_anchors -> questioning -> close.

The plan's separate "intro" stage is folded into the initial collect_anchors
node. The greeting is spoken from bot.py *after* flow_manager.initialize()
completes, not as a node pre-action: a pre-action greeting runs inside
_set_node before the system prompt and tools are applied, so a caller who
interrupts the greeting cancels node setup and the LLM runs unconfigured.
Each node is built from the session's Context, so the same graph drives any
screening type.

Prompt architecture note: the binding behaviour (stay in role, be terse, and —
critically — CALL THE TOOLS) lives in each node's ``role_message``, because
pipecat-flows delivers that as the LLM *system* instruction. ``task_messages``
are demoted to a user-role message by the Anthropic adapter, so anything the
agent must actually obey cannot live there — it would arrive as if the caller
said it. Keep ``task_messages`` as a short nudge; keep authority in role_message.
